11.6 通过XML-RPC实现简单的远程调用

You want an easy way to execute functions or methods in Python programs running on
remote machines.

Solution
Perhaps the easiest way to implement a simple remote procedure call mechanism is to
use XML-RPC. Here is an example of a simple server that implements a simple key-
value store:

from xmlrpc.server import SimpleXMLRPCServer

class KeyValueServer:
    _rpc_methods_ = ['get', 'set', 'delete', 'exists', 'keys']
    def __init__(self, address):
        self._data = {}
        self._serv = SimpleXMLRPCServer(address, allow_none=True)
        for name in self._rpc_methods_:
            self._serv.register_function(getattr(self, name))

    def get(self, name):
        return self._data[name]

    def set(self, name, value):
        self._data[name] = value

    def delete(self, name):
        del self._data[name]

    def exists(self, name):
        return name in self._data

    def keys(self):
        return list(self._data)

    def serve_forever(self):
        self._serv.serve_forever()

# Example
if __name__ == '__main__':
    kvserv = KeyValueServer(('', 15000))
    kvserv.serve_forever()

Here is how you would access the server remotely from a client:

>>> from xmlrpc.client import ServerProxy
>>> s = ServerProxy('http://localhost:15000', allow_none=True)
>>> s.set('foo', 'bar')
>>> s.set('spam', [1, 2, 3])
>>> s.keys()
['spam', 'foo']
>>> s.get('foo')
'bar'
>>> s.get('spam')
[1, 2, 3]
>>> s.delete('spam')
>>> s.exists('spam')
False
>>>

Discussion
XML-RPC can be an extremely easy way to set up a simple remote procedure call service.
All you need to do is create a server instance, register functions with it using the regis
ter_function() method, and then launch it using the serve_forever() method. This
recipe packages it up into a class to put all of the code together, but there is no such
requirement. For example, you could create a server by trying something like this:

from xmlrpc.server import SimpleXMLRPCServer
def add(x,y):
    return x+y

serv = SimpleXMLRPCServer(('', 15000))
serv.register_function(add)
serv.serve_forever()

Functions exposed via XML-RPC only work with certain kinds of data such as strings,
numbers, lists, and dictionaries. For everything else, some study is required. For in‐
stance,  if  you  pass  an  instance  through  XML-RPC,  only  its  instance  dictionary  is
handled:

>>> class Point:
...     def __init__(self, x, y):
...             self.x = x
...             self.y = y
...
>>> p = Point(2, 3)
>>> s.set('foo', p)
>>> s.get('foo')
{'x': 2, 'y': 3}
>>>

Similarly, handling of binary data is a bit different than you expect:

>>> s.set('foo', b'Hello World')
>>> s.get('foo')
<xmlrpc.client.Binary object at 0x10131d410>

>>> _.data
b'Hello World'
>>>

As a general rule, you probably shouldn’t expose an XML-RPC service to the rest of the
world as a public API. It often works best on internal networks where you might want
to write simple distributed programs involving a few different machines.
A downside to XML-RPC is its performance. The SimpleXMLRPCServer implementa‐
tion is only single threaded, and wouldn’t be appropriate for scaling a large application,
although it can be made to run multithreaded, as shown in Recipe 11.2. Also, since
XML-RPC  serializes  all  data  as  XML,  it’s  inherently  slower  than  other  approaches.
However, one benefit of this encoding is that it’s understood by a variety of other pro‐
gramming languages. By using it, clients written in languages other than Python will be
able to access your service.
Despite its limitations, XML-RPC is worth knowing about if you ever have the need to
make a quick and dirty remote procedure call system. Oftentimes, the simple solution
is good enough.
