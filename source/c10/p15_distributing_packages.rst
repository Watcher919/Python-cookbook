You’ve written a useful library, and you want to be able to give it away to others.

解决方案

If you’re going to start giving code away, the first thing to do is to give it a unique name
and clean up its directory structure. For example, a typical library package might look
something like this:

.. code-block:: python

    projectname/
        README.txt
        Doc/
            documentation.txt
        projectname/
            __init__.py
            foo.py
            bar.py
            utils/
                __init__.py
                spam.py
                grok.py
        examples/
            helloworld.py
            ...

To make the package something that you can distribute, first write a setup.py file that
looks like this:

.. code-block:: python

    # setup.py
    from distutils.core import setup

    setup(name='projectname',
        version='1.0',
        author='Your Name',
        author_email='you@youraddress.com',
        url='http://www.you.com/projectname',
        packages=['projectname', 'projectname.utils'],
    )

Next, make a file MANIFEST.in that lists various nonsource files that you want to include
in your package:

.. code-block:: python

    # MANIFEST.in
    include *.txt
    recursive-include examples *
    recursive-include Doc *

Make sure the setup.py and MANIFEST.in files appear in the top-level directory of your
package. Once you have done this, you should be able to make a source distribution by
typing a command such as this:

.. code-block:: python

    % bash python3 setup.py sdist

This will create a file such as projectname-1.0.zip or projectname-1.0.tar.gz, depending
on the platform. If it all works, this file is suitable for giving to others or uploading to
the `Python Package Index <http://pypi.python.org/>`_.

For pure Python code, writing a plain setup.py file is usually straightforward. One potential
gotcha is that you have to manually list every subdirectory that makes up the
packages source code. A common mistake is to only list the top-level directory of a
package and to forget to include package subcomponents. This is why the specification
for packages in setup.py includes the list packages=['projectname', 'project
name.utils'].


As most Python programmers know, there are many third-party packaging options,
including setuptools, distribute, and so forth. Some of these are replacements for the
distutils library found in the standard library. Be aware that if you rely on these
packages, users may not be able to install your software unless they also install the
required package manager first. Because of this, you can almost never go wrong by
keeping things as simple as possible. At a bare minimum, make sure your code can be
installed using a standard Python 3 installation. Additional features can be supported
as an option if additional packages are available.


Packaging and distribution of code involving C extensions can get considerably more
complicated. Chapter 15 on C extensions has a few details on this. In particular, see
Recipe 15.2.
