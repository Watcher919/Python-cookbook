10.13 安装私有的包
================================

----------
问题
----------
You want to install a third-party package, but you don’t have permission to install packages
into the system Python. Alternatively, perhaps you just want to install a package
for your own use, not all users on the system.

----------
解决方案
----------
Python has a per-user installation directory that’s typically located in a directory such
as ~/.local/lib/python3.3/site-packages. To force packages to install in this directory, give
the --user option to the installation command. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    python3 setup.py install --user

or

.. code-block:: python

    pip install --user packagename

The user site-packages directory normally appears before the system site-packages directory
on sys.path. Thus, packages you install using this technique take priority over
the packages already installed on the system (although this is not always the case depending
on the behavior of third-party package managers, such as distribute or pip).

----------
讨论
----------
Normally, packages get installed into the system-wide site-packages directory, which is
found in a location such as /usr/local/lib/python3.3/site-packages. However, doing so
typically requires administrator permissions and use of the sudo command. Even if you
have permission to execute such a command, using sudo to install a new, possibly unproven,
package might give you some pause.


Installing packages into the per-user directory is often an effective workaround that
allows you to create a custom installation.


As an alternative, you can also create a virtual environment, which is discussed in the
next recipe.
