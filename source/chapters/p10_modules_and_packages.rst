=============================

Modules and packages are the core of any large project, and the Python installation
itself. This chapter focuses on common programming techniques involving modules
and packages, such as how to organize packages, splitting large modules into multiple
files, and creating namespace packages. Recipes that allow you to customize the operation
of the import statement itself are also given.
