第十三章：脚本编程与系统管理
=============================

A lot of people use Python as a replacement for shell scripts, using it to automate common
system tasks, such as manipulating files, configuring systems, and so forth. The
main goal of this chapter is to describe features related to common tasks encountered
when writing scripts. For example, parsing command-line options, manipulating files
on the filesystem, getting useful system configuration data, and so forth. Chapter 5 also
contains general information related to files and directories.
