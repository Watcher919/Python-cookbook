第十四章：测试调试和异常
=============================

Testing rocks, but debugging? Not so much. The fact that there’s no compiler to analyze
your code before Python executes it makes testing a critical part of development. The
goal of this chapter is to discuss some common problems related to testing, debugging,
and exception handling. It is not meant to be a gentle introduction to test-driven development
or the unittest module. Thus, some familiarity with testing concepts is
assumed.
