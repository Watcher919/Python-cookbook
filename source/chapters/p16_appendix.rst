   It goes without saying that Python’s own online documentation is an excellent resource
   if you need to delve into the finer details of the language and modules. Just
   make sure you’re looking at the documentation for Python 3 and not earlier versions.

http://www.python.org/dev/peps
   Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) are invaluable if you want to understand
   the motivation for adding new features to the Python language as well as subtle
   implementation details. This is especially true for some of the more advanced language
   features. In writing this book, the PEPs were often more useful than the
   official documentation.

http://pyvideo.org
   This is a large collection of video presentations and tutorials from past PyCon conferences,
   user group meetings, and more. It can be an invaluable resource for learning
   about modern Python development. Many of the videos feature Python core
   developers talking about the new features being added in Python 3.

http://code.activestate.com/recipes/langs/python
   The ActiveState Python recipes site has long been a resource for finding the solution
   to thousands of specific programming problems. As of this writing, it contains
   approximately 300 recipes specific to Python 3. You’ll find that many of its recipes
   either expand upon topics covered in this book or focus on more narrowly defined
   tasks. As such, it’s a good companion.

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python
   Stack Overflow currently has more than 175,000 questions tagged as Python-related
   (and almost 5000 questions specific to Python 3). Although the quality of the questions
   and answers varies, there is a lot of good material to be found.
