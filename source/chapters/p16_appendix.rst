   It goes without saying that Python’s own online documentation is an excellent resource
   if you need to delve into the finer details of the language and modules. Just
   make sure you’re looking at the documentation for Python 3 and not earlier versions.

   Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) are invaluable if you want to understand
   the motivation for adding new features to the Python language as well as subtle
   implementation details. This is especially true for some of the more advanced language
   features. In writing this book, the PEPs were often more useful than the
   official documentation.
